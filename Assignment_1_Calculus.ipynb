        "Yes, I was able to understand and replicate the main idea of Euclid’s proof. He proves the Pythagorean Theorem by drawing squares on each side of a right triangle and then using lines parallel to the hypotenuse to divide the large square into two rectangles. Each of these rectangles has the same area as one of the smaller squares on the sides, so together they exactly fill the large one. What’s interesting is how Euclid convinces purely through geometry, no numbers. The proof feels almost visual."

Then, when a larger outer square is traced that connects the outer corners of those three smaller squares, the figure shows how the areas relate visually. The hypotenuse extends through the big square, dividing it into two parts — one that contains the larger square on the hypotenuse, and another that contains the two smaller squares from the legs. Both regions, including the extra spaces around the squares, balance perfectly. It’s like seeing the Pythagorean Theorem not through formulas but through symmetry"
