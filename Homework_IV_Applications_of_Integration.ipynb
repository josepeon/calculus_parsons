        "Dijksterhuis explains that Atomists saw the universe as made of tiny, indivisible particles moving in empty space, while the Platonic school viewed it as ordered by ideal, continuous forms and geometry. He argues this contrast helped shift science toward a mechanical worldview where nature was explained through measurable motion rather than abstract perfection. The difference matters because it marked the beginning of modern scientific thinking."

        "Deleuze and Guattari describe both atomistic and Platonic views as limited: one reduces everything to isolated parts, and the other to rigid ideals. They instead suggest reality works more like a network of dynamic flows and connections. Their writing is dense but intentionally challenges traditional thinking, using creative language to push readers toward new ways of understanding structure and change."
