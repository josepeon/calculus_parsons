# Interdisciplinary Calculus - Class Files# Calculus Parsons Problems



This repository contains class files and resources for the Interdisciplinary Calculus course at Parsons School of Design.This repository contains class files and resources for interactive Parsons problems focused on calculus concepts.



## Course Overview## About Parsons Problems



Interdisciplinary Calculus explores mathematical concepts through creative and design-oriented approaches, bridging the gap between mathematical theory and practical applications in art, design, and creative technology.Parsons problems are a type of programming exercise where students are given code fragments that they must arrange in the correct order to solve a problem. This approach helps students focus on understanding program logic and structure without getting bogged down in syntax details.



## About This Repository## Project Overview



This repository serves as a collection of class materials, assignments, projects, and resources that demonstrate the intersection of calculus with design thinking and creative problem-solving.This repository is designed to support calculus education through interactive coding exercises that combine mathematical concepts with programming logic. Students can practice:



## Course Focus- Understanding calculus concepts through code

- Logical thinking and problem-solving

- Mathematical concepts applied to design problems- Code structure and organization

- Computational approaches to calculus- Mathematical reasoning

- Visual and interactive representations of mathematical ideas

- Creative applications of mathematical principles## Repository Structure



## Repository StructureThis repository contains class files and educational resources for implementing calculus-focused Parsons problems.



This repository will contain class files, assignments, and projects developed throughout the course.## Getting Started



## Parsons School of DesignMore documentation and examples will be added as the project develops.



Part of The New School, Parsons School of Design emphasizes innovative approaches to education that combine creative practice with critical thinking across disciplines.## Contributing
